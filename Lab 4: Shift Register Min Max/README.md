# Lab 4 - Shift Register with Max/Min Detection

## Overview
This VHDL design implements a 4-register shift register with logic to determine the maximum and minimum values stored in the registers. The design uses clocked processes for synchronous operation and includes output selection for reading individual registers.

## Features
- 4-stage shift register (4-bit each)
- Real-time maximum value detection
- Real-time minimum value detection
- Synchronous reset
- Register output selection via 2-bit selector
- FPGA implementation ready
