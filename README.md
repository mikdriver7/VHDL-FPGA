# VHDL & FPGA Projects

This repository contains projects and labs developed for COEN 313 - Digital Logic Design I. The projects focus on VHDL design, simulation with ModelSim, and synthesis/implementation for Xilinx FPGAs using Vivado.

## Labs Overview

### Lab 1: Introduction to Simulation and Synthesis
- **Objective**: Introduction to ModelSim and Xilinx Vivado toolflows.
- **Design**: Structural VHDL implementation of a Full Adder using Half Adders.
- **Tools**: ModelSim for simulation, Vivado for synthesis and bitstream generation.
- **Hardware**: Nexys A7-100T FPGA Board.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- **VHDL Coding**: Structural and dataflow design styles.
- **Simulation**: Writing and using ModelSim DO files for test automation.
- **FPGA Synthesis**: Using Xilinx Vivado for synthesis, implementation, and bitstream generation.
- **Constraint Files**: Creating and applying XDC files for pin mapping and timing.
- **Hardware Debugging**: Programming and testing designs on physical FPGA hardware.

## Tools Used
- **Simulation**: ModelSim
- **Synthesis & Implementation**: Xilinx Vivado
- **FPGA Board**: Digilent Nexys A7-100T (Artix-7)
- **Hardware Description Language**: VHDL
